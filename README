Ever wondered if it was time to leave work?

Tired of clock watching?

Assuming that you work the ridiculous hours of 8.30am to 5.30pm you no longer need to sit there and look at the boring digital display i nthe bottom right corner of your screen... (Again assuming that you are working on a Windows computer :( )
